# IMDB-Movie-Data-Scraping-and-Enrichment
This project scrapes top-rated IMDB movies released between 2018 and 2020, sorted by user votes. It extracts movie details (ID, rank, title, runtime, year, rating, votes), cleans the data (converts runtime to minutes, fills missing values), and enriches an existing dataset before exporting it to a CSV file.
